Implementation and Analysis of the Algorithm Proposed by Chaudhary et. al for A lightweight Key Agreement Protocol for the Internet of Drones(IoD)

# Abstract:
Drones can be embedded in the system Internet of Drones can make a military observation of a region, a transport system embedded with sensors. Drones played a highly important role in different fields and brought great convenience to production and lifestyle. But we know all the data collected by sensors embedded in drones suffer from security challenges and privacy issues. There are a lot of authenticated key agreement protocols for the security of transmitted data through drones. We have analyzed a recent protocol, “A lightweight authentication and key agreement scheme for Internet of Drones” by Zhang et al. in the year 2020. We have found that this protocol is not secure against stolen smart card attacks, and the control server stores extra data. We have tried to address security issues of password guessing, anonymity, user/server impersonation, insider attack, and stolen smart card attacks, and man in the middle attack. We have proposed a modified lightweight authenticated key agreement protocol for Internet of Drones. We have proved its security in the random oracle model. We have done a performance analysis of the proposed protocol with relevant protocols that ensures its efficiency and security as well.
